Languages in Household
```{r}
lang_other <- table(combined$`Are there any other languages spoken in your home?`)
lang_other <- as.data.frame(lang_other)

colnames(lang_other)[1] <- "Other Language?"
colnames(lang_other)[2] <- "Count"

sum(lang_other$Count)

# sum was to see how many answers were given
```

```{r}
lang_other$`Other Language?` <- tolower(lang_other$`Other Language?`)
lang_other <- aggregate(Count ~ `Other Language?`, data = lang_other, sum)

lang_other <- (lang_other[-c(3,12:14), ])
sum(lang_other$Count)

# out of 69 total obs., only 18 households speak another language (outside of English) (after cleaning and removing English/No answers)
```

CN - to graph next ? combine the common languages to see how many languages are spoken / start data mining the birth orders and see how that looks @ 11:40am 
```{r}

```
